# ML Glossary - Distance Metrics

This directory contains explanations and examples of different distance metrics used in machine learning and data analysis. Each metric has its own dedicated folder with detailed markdown documentation.

## Available Distance Metrics

### 1. Euclidean Distance

Location: `Euclidean_Distance/`

- Most common distance metric
- Straight-line distance between points
- Mathematical formulation
- Use cases and examples

### 2. Manhattan Distance

Location: `Manhattan_distance/`

- City block distance
- Sum of absolute differences
- Mathematical formulation
- Comparison with Euclidean distance

### 3. Hamming Distance

Location: `Hamming_Distance/`

- Distance between binary strings
- Bit-wise comparison
- Mathematical formulation
- Applications in error detection

### 4. Cosine Similarity

Location: `Cosine_similarity/`

- Angle-based similarity measure
- Text similarity applications
- Mathematical formulation
- Normalization effects

### 5. Jaccard's Similarity Index

Location: `Jaccard's_Similarity_Index/`

- Set-based similarity measure
- Mathematical formulation
- Applications in text analysis
- Comparison with other metrics
