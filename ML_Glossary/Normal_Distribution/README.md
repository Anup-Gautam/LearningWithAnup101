# ML Glossary - Normal Distribution

This repository contains visualizations and explanations of the Normal Distribution, a fundamental concept in statistics and machine learning.

## NormalDistribution.py

This script creates comprehensive visualizations demonstrating various aspects of the normal distribution, including:

- Basic normal distribution properties
- Effect of mean and standard deviation
- 68-95-99.7 rule (Empirical Rule)
- Z-scores and standardization
- Applications in real-world scenarios

## NormalDistribution.md

This markdown file contains detailed explanations of:

- Definition and properties of normal distribution
- Mathematical formulation
- Key characteristics
- Common applications
- Relationship with other statistical concepts
- Practical examples and use cases

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd LearningWithAnup101/ML_Glossary

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Required Packages

```bash
# Install the required packages
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install pandas
pip install scipy
```

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
# Make sure you're in the Normal_Distribution directory
cd Normal_Distribution

# Run the visualization script
python NormalDistribution.py
```

The script will generate a visualization saved as 'normal_distribution_visualization.png' in the current directory and display the plot.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas
- scipy

## Output

### NormalDistribution.py generates visualizations showing:

1. Basic Normal Distribution

   - Bell curve shape
   - Symmetry around mean
   - Effect of parameters

2. Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7)

   - Standard deviations
   - Probability regions
   - Area under the curve

3. Z-scores and Standardization

   - Standard normal distribution
   - Z-score calculations
   - Probability calculations

4. Real-world Applications
   - Height distribution
   - Test scores
   - Natural phenomena

The visualization will be saved as 'normal_distribution_visualization.png' in the current directory.
