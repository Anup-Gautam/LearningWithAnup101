# Hypothesis Testing Scenarios

This document presents several real-world scenarios with clearly defined Null and Alternative Hypotheses, along with examples of Type I (False Positive) and Type II (False Negative) errors.

## Scenario 1: New Weight Loss Supplement

**Description**: A company tests a new supplement intended to help adults lose at least 5 kg in 3 months.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The supplement has no effect on weight loss (average weight loss = 0 kg).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The supplement causes weight loss (average weight loss > 0 kg).

### Possible Errors

- **Type I Error (False Positive)**
  - Concluding the supplement works (rejecting H₀) when in reality it does not lead to weight loss.
- **Type II Error (False Negative)**
  - Failing to detect the supplement’s effect (failing to reject H₀) when it actually helps users lose weight.

## Scenario 2: Email Spam Filter

**Description**: Testing an updated algorithm to filter spam emails.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The new algorithm does not improve spam detection (spam detection rate is unchanged).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The new algorithm improves spam detection (spam detection rate increases).

### Possible Errors

- **Type I Error (False Positive)**
  - Concluding the algorithm is better (rejecting H₀) when it actually has the same performance.
- **Type II Error (False Negative)**
  - Failing to recognize an improvement (failing to reject H₀) when the algorithm truly performs better.

## Scenario 3: Website Redesign Click-Through Rate

**Description**: Measuring whether a redesign increases click-through rate (CTR) on a homepage banner.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The redesign has no effect on CTR (CTR remains the same).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The redesign changes CTR (CTR ≠ previous CTR).

### Possible Errors

- **Type I Error (False Positive)**
  - Believing the redesign changes CTR (rejecting H₀) when there is no actual change.
- **Type II Error (False Negative)**
  - Missing a true change in CTR (failing to reject H₀) when the redesign truly affects user behavior.

## Scenario 4: Classroom Teaching Method

**Description**: A school tests a new teaching method aimed at improving students’ test scores.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The new method does not affect test scores (mean score unchanged).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The new method improves test scores (mean score increases).

### Possible Errors

- **Type I Error (False Positive)**
  - Concluding the method is effective when it actually has no impact on scores.
- **Type II Error (False Negative)**
  - Failing to identify the method’s benefit when it truly raises test scores.

## Scenario 5: Manufacturing Defect Rate

**Description**: Testing whether a new machine reduces the defect rate in production.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The new machine does not change the defect rate (defect rate unchanged).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The new machine changes the defect rate (defect rate decreases).

### Possible Errors

- **Type I Error (False Positive)**
  - Believing the machine reduces defects when defect rate is actually the same.
- **Type II Error (False Negative)**
  - Overlooking a real reduction in defects when the new machine truly performs better.
