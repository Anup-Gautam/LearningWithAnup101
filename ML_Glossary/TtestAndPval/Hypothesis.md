# Understanding Hypothesis in Research

A **hypothesis** is a proposed explanation or prediction of a scenario that can be tested through study and experimentation. It serves as a foundation for conducting scientific research and drawing conclusions based on evidence.

## üìò Types of Hypotheses

There are two main types of hypotheses in statistical testing:

### 1. Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)

- Represents the **"no effect"** or **"no difference"** position.
- Assumes that any kind of difference or significance you see in a set of data is due to chance.
- Considered true until evidence proves otherwise (like being _innocent until proven guilty_).

**Example**:  
ü©∫ _The medicine has no effect on blood pressure._

### 2. Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ or Ha)

- Contradicts the null hypothesis.
- States that there **is** a relationship or difference due to the effect being tested.
- This is what researchers aim to support with evidence.

**Example**:  
ü©∫ _The medicine changes blood pressure._

## üîÑ Types of Alternative Hypotheses

### Non-Directional Hypothesis

- Indicates that there is a difference, **but doesn‚Äôt specify the direction**.
- Used when researchers are only interested in finding a difference.

**Example**:  
ü©∫ _The new medication has an effect on blood pressure (either increase or decrease)._

### Directional Hypothesis

- Predicts the **specific direction** of the effect (increase or decrease).

**Example**:  
ü©∫ _The new medication decreases the blood pressure._

## üìä Logic of Hypothesis Testing (with Examples)

### 1. Start with the Null Hypothesis

- **Right**: Assume the medicine has no effect on blood pressure.
- **Wrong**: Assume the medicine definitely lowers blood pressure.

### 2. Collect Sample Data

- **Right**: Conduct a clinical trial with 100 patients and record their blood pressure before and after taking the medicine.
- **Wrong**: Collect opinions from people without actual data.

### 3. Calculate a Test Statistic

- **Right**: Use a t-test to compare the average blood pressure before and after the medication.
- **Wrong**: Just visually inspect the data without statistical testing.

### 4. Determine the Unlikeliness of Null Hypothesis

- **Right**: Check if the p-value is below 0.05 to decide statistical significance.
- **Wrong**: Assume any change automatically means the null is false.

### 5. Make a Decision: Reject or Fail to Reject H‚ÇÄ

- **Right**: If p < 0.05, reject the null hypothesis. If not, fail to reject it.
- **Wrong**: Say the null hypothesis is ‚Äúproven‚Äù or ‚Äútrue‚Äù based on one test.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Hypothesis Testing Errors

### Type I Error (False Positive)

- **Rejecting a true null hypothesis**.
- Saying that something works when it actually doesn't.
- Denoted by **alpha (Œ±)**, typically set at **0.05** (5%).

**Example**:  
ü©∫ Saying the medicine lowers blood pressure when it actually doesn't.

### Type II Error (False Negative)

- **Failing to reject a false null hypothesis**.
- Saying that something doesn‚Äôt work when it actually does.
- Denoted by **beta (Œ≤)**.

**Example**:  
ü©∫ Saying the medicine has no effect when it actually lowers blood pressure.

## ‚úÖ Characteristics of a Good Hypothesis (with Examples)

### 1. Clear and Precise

- ‚úÖ _The new medication lowers systolic blood pressure in adults over 60._
- ‚ùå _The medicine might help health a bit._

### 2. Falsifiable

- ‚úÖ _If blood pressure does not decrease after medication, the hypothesis is disproved._
- ‚ùå _This medicine is magical and works spiritually._ (Cannot be tested)

### 3. Based on Theory or Evidence

- ‚úÖ _Previous studies have shown related drugs reduce blood pressure, so we hypothesize this one will too._
- ‚ùå _I just feel like this might do something._

### 4. Relevant

- ‚úÖ _This hypothesis helps determine treatment for hypertension._
- ‚ùå _This hypothesis checks whether people like the color of the pill._

### 5. Operational

- ‚úÖ _"Lowering blood pressure" is defined as a 10 mmHg decrease in systolic pressure within 1 month of use._
- ‚ùå _It helps in some vague way._

üéØ _A well-constructed hypothesis sets the direction for scientific inquiry and helps avoid misinterpretation of data._
